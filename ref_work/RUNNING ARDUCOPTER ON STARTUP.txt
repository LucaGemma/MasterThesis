FIRST WAY: rc.local

sudo nano /etc/rc.local

Here you can add the tasks the BBBlue has to do at startup. It is a normal script. Just ensure to place an "&" when you launch arducopter 
(like this: /home/debian/arducopter/arducopter-3_5_4 -B /dev/ttyS2 -C udp:192.168.8.72:14560 &) in order no to be stuck forever!

SECOND WAY: ArduCopter.service

it seems that startup via /etc/rc.local is coming to an end and replaced by systemd tasks.
After some study I deleted the startup sequence in /etc/rc.local and replaced it by a new file:

sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/ArduCopter.service

    [Unit]
    Description=ArduCopter Service
    After=bb-wl18xx-wlan0.service

    [Service]
    ExecStartPre=/bin/echo uart > /sys/devices/platform/ocp/ocp\:P9_21_pinmux/state
    ExecStartPre=/bin/echo uart > /sys/devices/platform/ocp/ocp\:P9_22_pinmux/state
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/ardupilot/blue-arducopter -A udp:192.168.0.27:14550 -B /dev/ttyS2
    StandardOutput=null

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    Alias=arducopter.service

(see examples of .service files in /lib/systemd/system )

cd /lib/systemd/system

enable the new service with:
sudo systemctl enable arducopter.service

and start the service with:
sudo systemctl start arducopter.service

reboot BB Blue

#stop it with
sudo systemctl stop arducopter.service

sudo systemctl disable arducopter.service




ArduCopter is now saved as startup service every time the system boots.
